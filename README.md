# devrik backend API

This API will be used to easily add and query my portfolio projects (and maybe some other thing in the future).

It's using:

-   Express
-   TypeScript
-   MongoDb

It's far from done right now.

If you want to use this setup, feel free to clone the repo, and setup your own API. For **POST** requests you should setup a master password or something secure.

# Scripts

This will start **index.js** in the **dist** folder.

```
npm start
```

This will run the development server with nodemon. Will refresh after every change you made.

```
npm run dev
```

This will build the dist folder for you.

```
npm run build
```

Don't forget the **`npm install`**!
